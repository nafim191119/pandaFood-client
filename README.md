# Bistro Boss Restaurant

Welcome to the Bistro Boss Restaurant website! This repository showcases a modern and feature-rich restaurant website built using cutting-edge technologies. I have employed a range of powerful tools and frameworks to create an impressive user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React with VITE**: I have utilized the React framework along with VITE to build a highly efficient and performant front-end. This combination allows for faster development and seamless integration of components.

- **Tailwind CSS**: The website's design is powered by Tailwind CSS, a highly customizable CSS framework. With Tailwind, we have created a visually stunning and responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

- **Firebase Authentication**: To ensure secure and reliable user authentication, I have integrated Firebase Authentication. This feature allows users to sign up, log in, and access personalized features on the website.

- **JWT Token Authorization**: Our website employs JWT token authorization to ensure secure access to restricted resources. This adds an extra layer of protection and enhances the overall security of the application.

- **Axios and TanStack Query**: For optimized and secure data fetching, I have utilized Axios and TanStack Query. These tools enable efficient communication with the server, ensuring that data is retrieved and displayed seamlessly.

- **Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB**: The backend of our website is powered by Node.js and Express.js, providing a robust foundation for server-side operations. MongoDB is used for storing and managing data, ensuring scalability and reliability.
